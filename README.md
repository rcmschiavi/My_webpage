## My portfolio webpage

This repository was created with the intention of organize the previous reposritory, Temperature_dashboard. Which was created just to host a simple page for my data aquisition project but ended up increasing and it became an entire webpage.

On the previous repository I commited the django's project secret_key and that is not a good practice. Now I used dotenv to create a environment file for storing the keys and hash that I'll use along the project creation.

Thus, I'll use this repository to version control the webpage creation.
